This is a C++ project that appears to be related to system diagnostics and game requirements, possibly using DirectX diagnostics (DxDiag).

## Project Structure
- `DxDiagWorker.cpp/.h`: Handles DirectX diagnostic operations.
- `GameRequirementsWorker.cpp/.h`: Handles game requirements logic.
- `main.cpp`: Main entry point.
- `CMakeLists.txt`: CMake build configuration.
- `test.cpp`: Test file.
- `icon.ico`: Application icon.
- `dxdiag_output.txt`: Output from DxDiag.

## Build Instructions
1. **Requirements:**
   - CMake
   - C++ compiler (e.g., MSVC, MinGW)
   - Qt (if used in the project)
2. **Build Steps:**
   ```sh
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   cmake --build .
   ```

## Usage
